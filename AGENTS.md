# Information

- Run commands from the monorepo root.
- The package manager used is `bun`.
- Avoid `index.ts` barrel files;

## Structure

- `.repo/`: reference repositories
- `src/`: main files
- `docs/`: project documentation

## Working Loop

1. Identify the target app or package.
2. Follow local patterns in that directory.
3. Run focused checks/tests for the target.

# Learning more about the "effect" & "@effect/\*" packages

`.repo/effect/README.md` is an authoritative source of information about the
"effect" and "@effect/\*" packages. Read this before looking elsewhere for
information about these packages. It contains the best practices for using
effect.

Use this for learning more about the library, rather than browsing the code in
`node_modules/`.

## Engineering Principles

- **Proactive Progress**: Don't wait for instructions. Identify blockers, propose solutions, and push work forward autonomously.
- **Robust & Scalable**: Prefer solutions that work reliably and can grow. Avoid fragile hacks that break under load.
- **Globally Optimal**: Consider the whole system, not just the immediate fix. Trade-offs should be conscious and documented.
- **Verify Reality**: Test assumptions. A working demo beats a perfect plan.
- **Ship & Iterate**: Perfect is the enemy of done. Get to working state, then improve.
